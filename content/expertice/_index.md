# Expertice

## Drupal
For a period, bitwise was just specializing in Drupal. We have widened our scope, but of course not lost our expertice...

We offer:
- Installing Drupal with a basic set of modules and configurations thereof
- Creating a Drupal template from either HTML or a graphical layout
- Discovering and setting up various modules needed for the solution
- Setup is typically done on a development server and migrated when all is approved
- Module development

## Performance

No one loves a slow website. Neither do Google (and their ranking algorithm). Luckily there are many low hanging fruits and in many cases performance can be drastically improved with just a couple of hours of effort

Here are some techniques that we use:

- Examine the waterfall chart in order to spot bottlenecks
- Move static ressources such as images, CSS and javascript to CDN (also in Wordpress and Drupal)
- Concatenate CSS and javascript (also in Wordpress and Drupal)
- Order scripts and styles for best performance (also in Wordpress and Drupal)
- Defer javascript that can be deferred
- Use [picoquery](http://picoquery.com) instead of jQuery whenever possible. picoQuery is actually developed by us.
- For smaller websites, migration to a static website generator is a possibility. This website is build with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).
- Move entire static sites to CDN
- Use SVG's and SVG-tricks for icons
- Use webp images on clients that supports it
- Prefer pure CSS to script when possible. For example, the responsive menu on this site is pure CSS.

## Wordpress
We offer:
- Installing Wordpress with a basic set of modules and configurations thereof
- Creating a Wordpress template from either HTML or a graphical layout
- Discovering and setting up various modules needed for the solution
- Setup is typically done on a development server and migrated when all is approved
- Plugin development
