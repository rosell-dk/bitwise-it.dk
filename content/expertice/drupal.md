For a period, bitwise was just specializing in Drupal. We have widened our scope, but of course not lost our expertice...

We offer:
- Installing Drupal with a basic set of modules and configurations thereof
- Creating a Drupal template from either HTML or a graphical layout
- Discovering and setting up various modules needed for the solution
- Setup is typically done on a development server and migrated when all is approved
- Module development
